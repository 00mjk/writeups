# Square CTF 2018 - C5: de-anonymization

## Description
C5 is an online system and is thus very simple to disable. You just need to login as the Captain Yakubovics. Too bad sheâ€™s no longer around to hand you her password.

As luck would have it, you have some anonymized datasets lying around

## Solution

The online system consists of a login page, our goal is to login as _Captain Yakubovics_.

Pressing `Reset Password` shows us a form, asking different personal information.

We have a database composed by 5 different `.csv` file, each files contains different information.

- [1.csv](./data/1.csv): `email, job_title, income`
- [2.csv](./data/2.csv): `email, state`
- [3.csv](./data/3.csv): `ssn_last_four, state, street`
- [4.csv](./data/4.csv): `income, state, street, postal`
- [5.csv](./data/5.csv): `first_name, street`

Let's see if we manage to recover all the information we need to reset the password.

We start knowing `job_tile = Captain` and `last_name = Yakubovics`.

In [1.csv](./data/1.csv) there is exactly one entry that matches `yakubovics`, we obtain
`email = eyakubovics9t@nih.gov` and `income = 96605`.

Now that we know the `income` we can search for `96605` in [4.csv](./data/4.csv). Hopefully, once again, there is only one row matching our query. We collect some new information: `state = Florida`, `street = 4 Magdeline` and `postal = 33421`.

We repeat once again the same procedure, looking for `street` both inside [3.csv](./data/3.csv) and [5.csv](./data/5.csv). In each one of them - as a result - we find only one record. We get
`ssn_last_four = 4484` and `first_name = Elyssa`.

Now we have all the information required to reset the password, so let's do that!

We reach the actual reset page, which shows us the current password as a series of dots. Right click on it, `Inspect`, and we get the flag!
