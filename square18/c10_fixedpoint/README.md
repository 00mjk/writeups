# Square CTF 2018 - C10: fixed point

## Description
A handwritten note has been added to C10â€™s label.

```
If you are a Charvis then this is a simple application of Xkrithâ€™s First and Sixth Theorems.  If you are not a Charvis then you should familiarize yourself with Xkrithâ€™s works.  A primer can be found in Room 100034B.
```

Note: For the humans out there, this system is built on an oscillator. Itâ€™ll disable itself when you find the oscillatorâ€™s fixed point.

Good luck!

## Solution
The Javascript code in the given [HTML file](./fixed_point.html) applies the function below to our input `x`, and gives us the flag if and only if `x` is a fixed point (i.e. `f(x) = x`).

```
function f(x) {
  if ((x.substr(0, 2) == 'ğŸš€') && (x.slice(-2) == 'ğŸš€')) {
    return x.slice(2, -2);
  }
  if (x.substr(0, 2) == 'ğŸ‘½') {
    return 'ğŸš€' + f(x.slice(2));
  }
  if (x.substr(0, 2) == 'ğŸ“¡') {
    return f(x.slice(2)).match(/..|/g).reverse().join("");
  }
  if (x.substr(0, 2) == 'ğŸŒ—') {
    return f(x.slice(2)).repeat(5);
  }
  if (x.substr(0, 2) == 'ğŸŒ“') {
    var t = f(x.slice(2));
    return t.substr(0, t.length/2);
  }

  return "";
}
```

This function reads our input `emoji` by `emoji` interpreting each one of them as an instruction. Those instructions are pushed on the top of a stack. The final output of `f` is the result of applying all those instructions starting from the top of the stack, i.e. last in first out.

The mapping between `emojis` and instructions is the following:

- ğŸ‘½       -> put ğŸš€ on the stack
- ğŸ“¡       -> put `reverse` on the stack
- ğŸŒ—       -> put `repeat(5)` on the stack
- ğŸŒ“       -> put `substr(0, t.length/2)` on the stack
- ğŸš€`x`ğŸš€  -> put `x` on the stack (exit case)
- default -> put `''` on the stack (exit case)

We can do the following observations.

1. The only `emoji` that we can create is ğŸš€.
2. Following from `1.` , the only way we have to "create" other `emojis` is trough the `repeat(5)` operation. Of course the `emojis` we want to "create" have to be in the argument of `repeat(5)`.
3. From what above we conclude that the only acceptable exit case is ğŸš€`x`ğŸš€, and that `x` has to include all the `emojis` we need to "create".
4. ğŸ“¡ğŸ“¡ corresponds to the unit operation.
5. ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡ translates to `[reverse, ğŸš€ at beginning, reverse]`. The result of those three instructions will be adding a ğŸš€ at the end of our current sequence.

Now we have enough information to start building our input!

Let's define it to be `x`ğŸš€`x`ğŸš€, where `x = y`ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡. This will translate into `[..y.., reverse, ğŸš€ at beginning, reverse, x]`. Remebering that we have to apply the instructions backwards (i.e. starting from the right), after applying the first four we will end up with the following situation:

- Partial output: `x`ğŸš€
- Stack: `[..y..]` (i.e. the instructions encoded in `y`)

Thus, if we manage to have `y` such that its aggregation corresponds to `repeat(2)` we are done.
In other words we want to find a `u`and `v`such that:

```
    1 * 5^u * 2^-v = 2
```

Unfortunately there is no integer solution to this equation, but we can overcome this limitation by generalizing what stated above. We can define our input to be `x`ğŸš€ repeated `n` times (with `x` defined as before), so that, after applying the first four operations, the situation will be:

- Partial output: `x`ğŸš€ repeated `n-1` times
- Stack: `[..y..]` (i.e. the instructions encoded in `y`)

The equation to solve becomes:

```
    (n-1) * 5^u * 2^-v = n
```

Which hopefully has `{n = 5, u = 1, v = 2}` as a solution.

We obtain `y=`ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ—, thus `x=`ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ—ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡. Now we repeat `x`ğŸš€ five times and we are done!


ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ—ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡ğŸš€ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ—ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡ğŸš€ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ—ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡ğŸš€ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ—ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡ğŸš€ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ“ğŸŒ—ğŸ“¡ğŸ‘½ğŸ“¡ğŸš€

## Bonus

### Quines
The function `f` of this challenge is actually a [quine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quine_(computing)). Quines are programs that print out their own source code.

### Infinite solutions ğŸ“¡ğŸ“¡
Since ğŸ“¡ğŸ“¡ corresponds to the unit operation, there were an infinite number of solutions: one can add to his input as many couples of ğŸ“¡ as he wants.

Beside this, there are many solutions to the equation presented above and `{n = 5, u = 1, v = 2}` is only one of them.
